HTTML,CSS, JS

ramflorez@yahoo.com .

In order to satisfy the acceptance criteria, I did the following on the present repository.
First in the Document Object Module, I created classes and Ids for the start button, timer, top scores, feedback, starter screen, end screen and submit button.
The DOM was linked to two js files and the css file.
I created a style file with all the classes mentioned above to create the style of the different elements .ie. color, fonts, border, etc.
I also created a logic folder to declare all variables and functions that allow the page to run as requested. 
A second logic file was created to include questions as titles and an array with all the answer choices.
Another HTML file was used to create buttons to clear top scores and a "wrapper" class to allow keeping higher scores.
